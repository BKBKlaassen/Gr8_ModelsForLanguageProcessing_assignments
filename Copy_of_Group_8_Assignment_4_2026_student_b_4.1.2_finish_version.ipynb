However, if you debug your code by repeatedly running large amounts of GPU computation, you may run out of the GPU allocation provided by Google. One thing you should learn from this assignment is to use GPU compute strategically, debugging without a GPU or with reduced data or computation. (GPU resources are just as scarce in the 'real world', outside of the simple tasks we do in class: for example, there are open weight language models with advanced capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, that theoretically anyone can run, but in practice the hardware requirements are prohibitive.)\n",
